#🌿 CalmBreath – A Relaxing Breathing & Focus Game (Flutter)

CalmBreath is a beautifully minimal, relaxing Flutter app designed to help users:

🧘 Reduce stress

🎯 Improve focus

🌬️ Practice mindful breathing

🫧 Stay calm with a simple interaction game

The app blends breathing exercises with a gentle bubble-tapping activity, creating a soothing, meditative experience.

##✨ Features
###🫁 Guided Breathing (Inside the Bubble)

INHALE → HOLD → EXHALE

Smooth expanding/contracting breathing circle

Timer shown inside the bubble

Helps regulate breathing patterns gently

###🫧 Relaxing Bubble Game

A single bubble moves left ↔ right slowly

Designed to be calm and predictable (no randomness)

Difficulty increases very gently:

Score 0–24 → Very Slow

Score 25–49 → Slow

Score 50+ → Normal

Tap the bubble → Score + Quote

Tap anywhere else → Score resets

###🌟 Positive Affirmations

Every time you tap the bubble, a new calming quote appears at the top:

“Focus on Peace”
and more…
